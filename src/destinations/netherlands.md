From almost anywhere in the North / East / West of the country, you'll want to make your way to Dublin Port, get the ferry to Holyhead, and then direct train to London. At this point you can then choose to either get the Eurostar, or to get the Ferry to complete your journey to the Netherlands.

Check out the article on getting to London [here](london).
