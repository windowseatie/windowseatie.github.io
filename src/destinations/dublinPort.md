Actually getting to/from the ferry in Dublin is not necessarily the most straightforward thing.
- Dublin bus provide a regular bus service during the day (the 53), see indicative times here [Dublin Bus](http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Your-Journey1/Timetables/All-Timetables/53/)
- Nolan Coaches provide an express shuttle to the port (in theory numbered 853), see indicative schedule here [Nolan Coaches](https://www.nolancoaches.ie/services/ferry-shuttle-bus/)
- The quickest and most reliable option may just be to get a taxi. If arriving/departing in the nighttime, taxi will be your only option.
- Walk: you can get a Luas (tram) to the point, or use a bike share scheme to roughly the same location, and from there walk to the ferry terminals. Stena Line are a 3.2km walk while Irish Ferries are a 3.7km walk. This is not the most comfortable route to walk in the world though so other options would be nicer.
