From almost anywhere in the North / East / West of the country, you'll want to make your way to Dublin Port, get the ferry to Holyhead, and then direct train to London.

# Travel Options
See the ferry times and indicative train times listed in the tables below. Do make sure to double-check the times for your date as they may change. As you'll see below, basically your only option for getting to London without having to wait overnight in train stations is to leave Dublin in the morning. 
See the other page [here](/destinations/dublinPort) about getting to or from Dublin Port
- Check ferry times on [Irish Ferries](https://www.irishferries.com) or [Stena Line](https://booking.stenaline.ie)
- Check UK train times at [Transport For Wales](https://tickets.trc.cymru/#/ticket-search/)

/* Irish Ferries sail the swift service at 07:30 or 08:20 on alternate days and it is cancelled in winter so the timetable can vary week to week, check their website for the times on your day.

## Leaving Dublin at Lunchtime (or coming from elsewhere in Ireland on the same day)
The option here is basically only if the Irish Ferries swift service is running, it'll get you to London before 11pm. I included the stena service for reference but the trains don't really run late enough to make use of it. On weekdays there's a train that leaves Holyhead for London at 18:26 but I don't feel like there's much chance of making that. Not sure whether to blame the ferry operators or the UK Rail for this one.

## After Work
The Sail&Rail options here aren't great, you can get to London Euston for 9am but you'll have a lengthy wait in Holyhead in the middle of the night. Stena Line depart at 20.30 (arriving Holyhead at midnight) and Irish Ferries have a ferry departing Dublin at 20.55 (arriving Holyhead at 00:20), you then have to wait in Holyhead until the 04:25 (weekend) or 4:48 (weekday) train.

The best option for this used to be the Bus Éireann / Eurolines bus from Dublin to London, leaving Dublin at 20:00 and arriving in London Victoria at 08:15 but that has now been cancelled.

# Cost
The Sail & Rail cost will be €60 each way from Dublin to London, and up to €80 each way from other train stations in Ireland to London. Prices do vary based on distance but they do not do demand pricing so you can book for the same price usually right up to the day of departure.

# Buy Tickets
## Sail & Rail
Your one ticket will cover all of train travel in Ireland with Irish Rail, the ferry to the UK, and the train across the UK to your destination. Prices do vary based on distance but they do not do demand pricing so you can book for the same price usually right up to the day of departure.

Stena Line generally seem to have better prices, but don't currently do online bookings to if you're comparing price it's best to give them a ring before booking Irish Ferries.
